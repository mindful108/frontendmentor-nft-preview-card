## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with custom properties (variables)
- CSS animations
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Plain JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a beautiful yet simple design, so I decided to spend more of my time refining the hover states and adding animations. I tried to rely solely on CSS, but due to the structure of my HTML I had to use JavaScript when adding the outline to the image when hovering the NFT title (h1).

I primarily relied on my existing knowledge and experience with using ```::before``` and ```::after``` pseudo elements for adding the cyan overlay and eye icon when hovering the main image.

I probably could have made the hover animation for the artist's name work with pure CSS, but since I had already written the JavaScript for the title/image outline effect, it was easy just to add it there.

I could probably spend more time trying match the shadow for the card, but I think it sufficient based on the design photo (I don't have access to the Figma file.)

Altogether this was a fun and satisfying project that I did in just a few hours, most of the time spent on refining the interactions and animations.

### Continued development

I plan to do more Frontend Mentor projects to continue developing my speed and workflow using my own custom snippets and starter templates. I will also start to use Tailwind CSS and as I learn React I'll start using that for more interactive challenges.

### Useful resources

I used various web searches for implementing the various animations but have no specific resources to share for this particular project.
